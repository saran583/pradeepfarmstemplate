Hypervisor- A software or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines
                   
	 A computer which runs the virtual machine is called a Host
                   
	 A virtual m achine is called  a guest machine

These are divided into 2 types
	 
          Type1-Much of a operating system like a dual boot

Powershell has 4 different versions.they are:

          Powershell Console- Used for administrative tasks both and locally and remote

          Elevated Console

          x86 Console - This is for running power shell remotely which are 32bit not 64 bit
 
          Power Shell ISE - Allows both immediate tasks and administration and allows to 
		    write scripts for repetition or automation of tasks.
 



Scenario-1: Suppose we have a system which cannot connect to the internet but the powershell 
	 help should be updated but you have another system with internet. what do you do?

Solution:The updated help can be saved to a file and can be updated by sending it into the req system

              Step1: Run Update-Help in the internet connected system and update the packages

              Step2: Now save the updated packages into a directory using Save-Help it asks for a destination 
	       if you want to save in the same directory enter .\ and click enter

              Step3: All the updated packages should be saved into the current directory by now check by 
                         entering dir or dir | measure to count the number of files.

              Step4: now Copy the directory to the system and Run "Update-Help -SourcePath .\"

              Step5: And therefore it is done.



Note: Aliases can be used instead of using the whole command.

          PowerShell Uses .Net Framework at its core.


          Powershell can identify the values gb and can execut the query

Scenario2:Run notepad and stop the process 

Solution:Step1:Run  the cmdlet "notepad" which starts the process

              Step2:Stop the process using stop-process -name notepad"

              Step3:Here we go...



PSProviders- These are used to define the logic that is used to access, navigate or edit a datastore, 
	    It is the many providers like Filesystem,Aliases,Registry,Environment,etc



PSDrives- These provide a entry point to the datastore, and uses the providers for standard logic, 
	PSDrives are used to provide a entry point or a shortcut into the providers.

$sign added before a variable to make powershell understand that it is a variable

Scenario3:Get the free space of all the drives and display the data of only name and 
                  freespace and then a new column with the free space in gb
Solution: It is done by executing a query
              Step1: Gives the specific values Name and Freespace 
                   -->Get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk | Select-Object DeviceID, FreeSpace
                          
              Step2: By adding a query we can get the new column In GB  
                   -->Get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk | Select-Object DeviceID, FreeSpace, 
                        @{name="In GB"; Expression={$_.FreeSpace/1GB}}
